# Tennis App
Tennis App is a Flutter-based mobile application developed as a final project for the Systems Engineering degree. It serves as a comprehensive tournament management tool for tennis, integrating data from a custom API created by another student. The application provides valuable insights such as tournament details, match results, match schedules by categories, and enables user-friendly filtering options by dates and player names.
